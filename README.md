The header HTML|CSS|JS|Results buttons display/hide the panes for code writing
when you write you code simply hit the RUN button in upper right corner and the results panel will display your coding results


Issues
1. still need to adjust tab button so users can use tab instead of space currently tab buttons switches between active panels
2. CSS site to make it look more like a old dos command line
